# Abstract
In this work, a single-step triangular splitting (SSTS) iteration method is proposed for solving a class
of block two-by-two real linear system which arises from complex symmetric linear system. Then, we
investigate the convergence properties of this method and determine its optimal iteration parameters as
well as corresponding optimal convergence factor. It is worth mentioning that the SSTS iteration method
is robust and superior to SBTS and PSBTS iteration methods under suitable conditions. Finally, some
numerical experiments are carried out to validate the theoretical results and evaluate this new method.
